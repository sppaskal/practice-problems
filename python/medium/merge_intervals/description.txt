Combine overlapping intervals into a minimal set of non-overlapping ones.

🔍 Problem Summary
You're given a list of intervals like:

Code
[[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]]
Your task is to merge overlapping intervals. In this case:

[1,3] and [2,6] overlap → merge into [1,6]

Others don’t overlap

Output: [[1,6], [8,10], [15,18]]
